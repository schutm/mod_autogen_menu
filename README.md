mod_autogen_menu
================
The main purpose of the mod is to generate a menu contents automatically, by displaying
links to all articles in the chosen section or category. So when you add a new article,
you don’t have to link it to menu manually – the menu automatically displays the link.
Categories in the chosen section may work as headings/separators among menus and/or they
can link to the category list. The mod is quite light-weight and also offers a basic
possibility to customize the output. The package contains english and czech language
files.
