Canonical source
================
The (non-maintained) canonical source of mod_autogen_menu is hosted on [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/schutm/mod_autogen_menu).

mod_autogen_menu
================
The main purpose of the mod is to generate a menu contents automatically, by displaying
links to all articles in the chosen section or category. So when you add a new article,
you don’t have to link it to menu manually – the menu automatically displays the link.
Categories in the chosen section may work as headings/separators among menus and/or they
can link to the category list. The mod is quite light-weight and also offers a basic
possibility to customize the output. The package contains english and czech language
files.

Contributing
------------
I do not use Joomla! Additionally I do not support the way the code has been written
(code layout, duplication of code, etc.), therefor I do not maintain this module. A log
of clean up needs to be done on the code, if you like to do this or want to maintain
the code, please fork or create a pull-request.
